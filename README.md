This app titled "sp500-kpi-app" contains a comprehensive dataset of the key performance indicators (KPIs) for the S&P 500 companies. This version is updated as of November 2024 according to official SEC filings. If you navigate to the panel tabs, you can visualize the relationship between KPIs of a company and compare performance between companies by selecting a sector(s) and company by name(s) or ticker symbol(s). You can also find a data table containing the KPIs for each company, which can be filtered by sector.
