## Get Oriented
This app titled "sp500-kpi-app" contains a comprehensive dataset of the key performance indicators (KPIs) for the S&P 500 companies. This version is updated as of November 2024 according to official SEC filings. This app allows users to select S&P 500 companies to plot on a scatter plot and compare the relationship between various key performance indicators (KPIs). There are multiple panel tabes that can be navigated, where a data table containing the KPIs for each company can be found. This table can be filtered by sector and sorted by KPI values.

This repo contains the app.R file used to build the UI and server, as well as the original unedited dataset.
